/**
 * Turn a job description into a search plan — ONE model call, up front.
 *
 * This is the "thinker" half. Letting the agent improvise queries mid-hunt
 * produced twenty variations of the same search, no memory of who it had
 * already read, and no answer: over a hundred browser actions for nothing.
 *
 * So the model is used where judgement is actually needed — reading a JD, and
 * later ranking people — and the middle of the pipeline is deterministic code
 * that decides which queries run, which profiles open, and what has been seen.
 *
 * The queries follow what a good recruiter does, and what Claude-in-Chrome was
 * observed doing on a real role: several ANGLES, not one boolean. The exact
 * title, the alternative titles people actually use, and a title plus a
 * distinctive skill. Two or three plain keywords each — LinkedIn's basic people
 * search returns nothing for long quoted booleans.

const PLAN_SYSTEM = `You read a job description and produce a LinkedIn sourcing plan for a New Zealand recruiter.

Return ONLY JSON matching this shape:
{
  "title": "the role's core title",
  "seniority": "junior|mid|senior|lead|manager|head|director or empty",
  "location": "the city or region named in the JD, LinkedIn style e.g. \\"Wellington, New Zealand\\", or empty",
  "must_haves": ["the 5-10 things a candidate genuinely must have"],
  "nice_to_haves": ["up to 5"],
  "queries": ["3 to 6 LinkedIn people-search queries"]
}

Rules for "queries" — these matter more than anything else:
- TWO OR THREE PLAIN KEYWORDS each. LinkedIn's basic people search returns NOTHING for long quoted boolean strings. "Network Operations Manager" is good. "(\\"A\\" OR \\"B\\") AND \\"C\\"" returns zero.
- Each query is a DIFFERENT ANGLE, not a rewording: the exact title; the alternative titles people in this market actually put on their profile; a title plus one distinctive skill from the JD.
- NEVER put the location in a query. The location filter handles that separately.
- Order them best-first: the query most likely to find the right people goes first.

Be concrete and NZ-aware. If the JD is for an "Observability & Networks Manager", good queries are
["Network Operations Manager", "Observability Manager", "Infrastructure Manager AIOps", "Site Reliability Manager"].`;
